# This is a markdown for *Hunt Showdown*
## Hunt is a first person shooter, player verses player/player verses enviroment video game.
### In hunt you play as a "hunter" who has been sent deep into the monster infested towns and wilds of a late 1800's louisiana in order to exterminate the large and dangerous creatures that have taken control of the land.
### Similarly to many games now-a-days Hunt is constantly recieving intreguining updates that change aspects of play. For instance one of the most recent updates introduced a new boss and boss concept into the game by the name of *RotJaw*. __*RotJaw*__ is a massive American Alligator who is considered to be a *Wild* target meaning that she can be found in any of the games waters on each map and unlike the other "~~simple~~ more traditional" bosses as shown in the photo below.
