# This is a markdown for *Hunt Showdown*
## Hunt is a first person shooter, player verses player/player verses enviroment video game.
### Hunt establishes a reality where paranormal creatures are able to influence our world and corrupt the inhabitance of an area. In hunt you play as a "hunter" who has been sent into one of three different sights where a mysterious entity has corrupted the people and wildlife turning most if not all into undead or monsterous shadows of their former selves. In each of the infested towns the hunters goal is to exterminate the large and dangerous creatures that act as focal points for the corruption in the land however they must also compete with other hunters in order to be the one that takes creatures mark as proof of bounty.
### Similarly to many games now-a-days Hunt is constantly recieving intreguining updates that change aspects of play. For instance one of the most recent updates introduced a new boss and boss concept into the game by the name of *RotJaw*. __*RotJaw*__ is a massive American Alligator who is considered to be a *Wild* target meaning that she can be found in any of the games waters on each map and unlike the other "~~simple~~ more traditional" bosses as shown in the photo below.
