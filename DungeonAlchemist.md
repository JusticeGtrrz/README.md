# Dungeon Alchemist
## I like to play the table top game D&D with my friends when we are all available and as the groups host most often times it is useful to have a prepared tileset map for areas that may be encountered, I utilize dungeon alchemest it is a computer application that I helped to kickstart during the year of 2021
> ## I found dungeon alchemist interesting for the reasons as follows
>> + ## It allowed for quick creation of tile maps that look professional
>> + ## It eliminates the need for drawing which I am not great at
>> + ## It allows for me to become inspired by randomly generating maps
>> + ## It works with several different online D&D hosting methods
>> + ## Maps are able to be printed on regular or special sized pages.
